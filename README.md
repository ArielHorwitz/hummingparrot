# MockingParrot
A TUI Chat Client for ChatGPT in early development.

## Getting started
Clone the repo and use `cargo run`. MockingParrot will generate a config file at `~/.config/mockingparrot/config.toml`. You will need to copy your [API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) into the config file. The app needs to be re-run to reload the config file.
